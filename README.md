## JavaScript Timing and Arithmetic Practice

This practice set covers essential JavaScript concepts, including `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and basic arithmetic operations. Each question is designed to test your understanding of asynchronous operations and mathematical computations in JavaScript.

### Questions

1. **Delayed Message Display**
   - Write a function that displays "Hello, World!" after a delay of 3 seconds.

2. **Time Logger**
   - Create a function that logs the current time to the console every 2 seconds, stopping after 10 seconds.

3. **Delayed Sum Calculation**
   - Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and logs their sum after a 2-second delay.

4. **Countdown Timer**
   - Implement a countdown timer that starts from 5 and counts down to 0, displaying each number with a 1-second interval. When it reaches 0, print "Time's up!" after an additional 1-second delay.

5. **Delayed Multiplication**
   - Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their product after a 1-second delay.
